1293,IEEE SCC2,SOAC: A Conceptual Model for Managing Service-Oriented Authorization.,"A web service can be composed of multiple component web services in a loosely-coupled environment Traditional Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is inadequate for the authorization management of composite services since the administration of the component web services has not been taken into consideration In this paper, we propose a novel conceptual model, named as Service Oriented Authorization Control (SOAC) to facilitate the administration and management for both service consumers and component web services A set of administrative functions are also provided for managing the elements of SOAC This research will be the first step towards managing service-oriented authorization."
1294,SCC3,Description and Evaluation of Elasticity Strategies for Business Processes in the Cloud.,"In the recent years, growing attention has been paid to the concept of Cloud Computing as a new computing paradigm for executing and handling operations/processes in an efficient and cost-effective way Cloud Computing’s elasticity and its flexibility in service delivery have been the most important features behind this attention which encourage companies to migrate their operation/processes to the cloud to ensure the required QoS while using resources and reduce their expenses Elasticity management has been considered as a pivotal issue among IT community that works on finding the right tradeoffs between QoS levels and operational costs by developing novel methods and mechanisms However, controlling process elasticity and defining non-trivial elasticity strategies are challenging issues Also, despite the growing attention paid to the cloud and its elasticity property in particular, there is still a lack of solutions that support the evaluation of elasticity strategies used to ensure t."

1298,IEEE SCC7,Global Service Space Construction and Its Application to Workflow as a Service.,"Results The Cronbach's alpha for the four dimensions used in developing CI was 843 Validation of CI revealed that it was correlated to internal dimensions ( system quality , R = 828; information quality , R = 909; use , R = 969; and user satisfaction , R = 679) and to external factors (JAHIS level, R = 832 and patient safety culture, R = 585) These results suggest that CI could be a reliable and valid measure of the effectiveness of EMR systems in the responding hospitals On benchmarking of hospitals, 300% (6/20) of the responding hospitals performed less than satisfactory on CI and that majority of the hospitals performed poorly on user satisfaction  Conclusions CI has provided a standard way, through quantitative means, of measuring, comparing and categorizing the effectiveness of EMR systems in hospitals CI can be a powerful tool for benchmarking the effectiveness of EMR systems in hospitals in ways that can guide hospitals in computerization process as well as benchmark their syst."
1299,IEEE SCC8,Service Level Composition across Multiple Service Chains.,"Tracing items in a supply chain, across different enterprises and through the full processes scope, is today an inherently complex design task Enterprises are typically comprised of hundreds of applications that are custom built at different times, acquired from third parties and parts of legacy systems, and also operating in multiple tiers of different manufacturing and information system platforms Further, traceability is characterized by a goal-oriented approach, in which business-process analyses are driven by goal achievements rather than by systematic engineering processes The use of a classical enterprise integration approach mostly needs tailoring to different applications Due to the number and diversity of the systems and of their interactions, and to their dynamicity, it is difficult, costly, and therefore often not convenient to develop in large scale distributed systems To overcome these issues, a supply chain traceability system with a high level of automation is discusse."

1302,IEEE SCW1,Services Composition Modeling with Mobility and Time.,"Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is emerging as the next inevitable technology for application developments One fundamental issue of SOA is service composition, ie, to seamlessly compose distributed services into more complex applications In the mobile environment, a service composition may face disruptions caused by the movement of both users and service providers Thus, a dependable service composition is desired to handle the mobility in the environment In this paper, we propose to achieve dependable service composition by taking the mobility prediction of the service providers into consideration We exploit the fact that the service providers can predict their stay time in the current environment However, some uncertainty may exist in the prediction such that a service provider may move out of the current environment earlier than the prediction We use two models to characterize the uncertainty, a probability-free model and a probabilistic model Our objective is to design dependab."
1303,SCC2,Cost-Effective Request Scheduling for Greening Cloud Data Centers.,"The growing deployment of Internet services in cloud data centers significantly increases the grid energy cost of cloud providers Considering the environmental effect, many of current cloud providers migrate to green cloud data centers (GCDCs), and seek to reduce the usage of brown energy by partially (or entirely) adopting renewable energy sources However, the temporal diversity in the grid price, wind speed and solar irradiance makes it a big challenge to minimize the grid energy cost of a GCDC while meeting the performance of each delay bounded request This work proposes a Temporal Request Scheduling algorithm (TRS) that jointly considers the temporal diversity TRS considers the long tail in real-life requests' delay, and can provide strict delay assurance to all arriving requests by scheduling them to execute within their delay bound Besides, this work explicitly provides mathematical modeling of the relation between the service rate in a GCDC and the refusal of delay bounded requ."
1304,IEEE SCC (2)3,Using an Interface Proxy to Host Versioned Web Services.,"Concentrations of geogenic Cr(VI) in groundwater that exceed the World Health Organization’s maximum contaminant level for drinking water (50 μg L −1 ) occur in several locations globally The major mechanism for mobilization of this Cr(VI) at these sites is the weathering of Cr(III) from ultramafic rocks and its subsequent oxidation on Mn oxides This process may be occurring in the southern Sacramento Valley of California where Cr(VI) concentrations in groundwater can approach or exceed 50 μg L −1  To characterize Cr geochemistry in the area, samples from several soil auger cores (approximately 4 m deep) and drill cores (approximately 25 m deep) were analyzed for total concentrations of 44 major, minor and trace elements, Cr associated with labile Mn and Fe oxides, and Cr(VI) Total concentrations of Cr in these samples ranged from 140 to 2220 mg per kg soil Between 9 and 70 mg per kg soil was released by selective extractions that target Fe oxides, but essentially no Cr was associated."

1317,SCC6,A Time-Aware Method to Process Behavioral Similarity Calculation.,"Dual Process Theories (DPT) of reasoning posit that judgments are mediated by both fast, automatic processes and more deliberate, analytic ones A critical, but unanswered question concerns the issue of monitoring and control: When do reasoners rely on the first, intuitive output and when do they engage more effortful thinking? We hypothesised that initial, intuitive answers are accompanied by a metacognitive experience, called the Feeling of Rightness (FOR), which can signal when additional analysis is needed In separate experiments, reasoners completed one of four tasks: conditional reasoning ( N = 60), a three-term variant of conditional reasoning ( N = 48), problems used to measure base rate neglect ( N = 128), or a syllogistic reasoning task ( N = 64) For each task, participants were instructed to provide an initial, intuitive response to the problem along with an assessment of the rightness of that answer (FOR) They were then allowed as much time as needed to reconsider their ini."

1550,IEEE SCC9,Web Services Conversion.,"We present a framework for analyzing interactions among Web services that communicate with asynchronous messages We model the interactions among the peers participating in a composite Web service as conversations, the global sequences of messages exchanged among the peers This naturally leads to the following model checking problem: Given an LTL property and a composite Web service, do the conversations generated by the composite Web service satisfy the property? We show that asynchronous messaging leads to state space explosion for bounded message queues and undecidability of the model checking problem for unbounded message queues We propose a technique called synchronizability analysis to tackle this problem If a composite Web service is synchronizable, its conversation set remains the same when asynchronous communication is replaced with synchronous communication We give a set of sufficient conditions that guarantee synchronizability and that can be checked statically Based on our ."

1614,IEEE SCC3,Balancing Access To Highly Accessed Keys In Peer-to-Peer Systems.,"As computer networks increase in size, become more heterogeneous and span greater geographic distances, applications must be designed to cope with the very large scale, poor reliability, and often, with the extreme dynamism of the underlying network Aggregation is a key functional building block for such applications: it refers to a set of functions that provide components of a distributed system access to global information including network size, average load, average uptime, location and description of hotspots, and so on Local access to global information is often very useful, if not indispensable for building applications that are robust and adaptive For example, in an industrial control application, some aggregate value reaching a threshold may trigger the execution of certain actions; a distributed storage system will want to know the total available free space; load-balancing protocols may benefit from knowing the target average load so as to minimize the load they transfer We."
