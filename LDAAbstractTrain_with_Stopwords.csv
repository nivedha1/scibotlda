131,ICWS0,Web Service Selection for Resolving Conflicting Service Requests.,"Web service selection based on quality of service (QoS) has been a research focus in an environment where many similar web services exist Current methods of service selection usually focus on a single service request at a time and the selection of a service with the best QoS at the user's own discretion The selection does not consider multiple requests for the same functional web services Usually, there are multiple service requests for the same functional web service in practice In such situations, conflicts occur when too many requesters select the same best web service This paper aims at solving these conflicts and developing a global optimal service selection method for multiple related service requesters, thereby optimizing service resources and improving performance of the system It uses Euclidean distance with weights to measure degree of matching of services based on QoS A 0-1 integral programming model for maximizing the sum of matching degree is created and consequently, a g."

166,ICWS5,Communication Web Services Composition and Integration.,"We present a framework for analyzing interactions among Web services that communicate with asynchronous messages We model the interactions among the peers participating in a composite Web service as conversations, the global sequences of messages exchanged among the peers This naturally leads to the following model checking problem: Given an LTL property and a composite Web service, do the conversations generated by the composite Web service satisfy the property? We show that asynchronous messaging leads to state space explosion for bounded message queues and undecidability of the model checking problem for unbounded message queues We propose a technique called synchronizability analysis to tackle this problem If a composite Web service is synchronizable, its conversation set remains the same when asynchronous communication is replaced with synchronous communication We give a set of sufficient conditions that guarantee synchronizability and that can be checked statically Based on our ."

417,ICWS6,A Service-Oriented System for Optimizing Residential Energy Use.,"Scenarios are used to explore the consequences of different adaptation and mitigation strategies under uncertainty In this paper, two scenarios are used to explore developments with (1) no mitigation leading to an increase of global mean temperature of 4 °C by 2100 and (2) an ambitious mitigation strategy leading to 2 °C increase by 2100 For the second scenario, uncertainties in the climate system imply that a global mean temperature increase of 3 °C or more cannot be ruled out Our analysis shows that, in many cases, adaptation and mitigation are not trade-offs but supplements For example, the number of people exposed to increased water resource stress due to climate change can be substantially reduced in the mitigation scenario, but adaptation will still be required for the remaining large numbers of people exposed to increased stress Another example is sea level rise, for which, from a global and purely monetary perspective, adaptation (up to 2100) seems more effective than mitigati."
418,ICWS7,Generating Executable Workflows from Solution Plans.,"In many scientific workflows, particularly those that operate on spatially oriented data, jobs that process adjacent regions of space often reference large numbers of files in common Such workflows, when processed using workflow planning algorithms that are unaware of the application's file reference pattern, result in a huge number of redundant file transfers between grid sites and consequently perform poorly This work presents a generalized approach to planning spatial workflow schedules for Grid execution based on the spatial proximity of files and the spatial range of jobs We evaluate our solution to this problem using the file access pattern of an astronomy application that performs co-addition of images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey We show that, in initial tests on Grids of 5 to 25 sites, our spatial clustering approach eliminates 50% to 90% of the file transfers between Grid sites relative to the next-best planning algorithms we tested that were not \spatially aware\ At mo."

564,ICWS3,Heuristic Based Time-Aware Service Selection Approach.,"With the rapidly increasing number of independently developed Web services that provide similar functionalities with varied quality of service (QoS), service composition is considered as a problem in the selection of component services that are in accordance with users' QoS requirements; a practice known as the QoS-aware service composition problem However, current solutions are unsuitable for most real-time decision-making service composition applications required to obtain a relatively optimal result within a reasonable amount of time These services are also unreliable (or even risky) given the open service-oriented environment In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel heuristic algorithm for an efficient and reliable selection of trustworthy services in a service composition The proposed algorithm consists of three steps First, a trust-based selection method is used to filter untrustworthy component services Second, convex hulls are constructed to reduce the sear."

572,ICWS1,Towards Integrated Service Adaptation.,"The push toward business process automation has generated the need for integrating different enterprise applications involved in such processes The typical approach to integration and to process automation is based on the use of adapters and message brokers The need for adapters in Web services mainly comes from two sources: one is the heterogeneity at the higher levels of the interoperability stack, and the other is the high number of clients, each of which can support different interfaces and protocols, thereby generating the need for providing multiple interfaces to the same service In this paper, we characterize the problem of adaptation of web services by identifying and classifying different kinds of adaptation requirements Then, we focus on business protocol adapters, and we classify the different ways in which two protocols may differ Next, we propose a methodology for developing adapters in Web services, based on the use of mismatch patterns and service composition technologi."

772,ICWS1,OWL-S Process Model Matchmaking.,"Research on semantic web services promises greater interoperability among software agents and web services by enabling content-based automated service discovery and interaction and by utilizing Although this is to be based on use of shared ontologies published on the semantic web, services produced and described by different developers may well use different, perhaps partly overlapping, sets of ontologies Interoperability will depend on ontology mappings and architectures supporting the associated translation processes The question we ask is, does the traditional approach of introducing mediator agents to translate messages between requestors and services work in such an open environment? This article reviews some of the processing assumptions that were made in the development of the semantic web service modeling ontology OWL-S and argues that, as a practical matter, the translation function cannot always be isolated in mediators Ontology mappings need to be published on the semantic ."

794,ICWS3,A Novel Framework for Service Set Recommendation in Mashup Creation.,"With an overwhelming number of web services online, recommending services for automatic mashup creation greatly facilitates the composition process of developers Various approaches have been proposed for the task However, these approaches concentrate on improving the recommending accuracy of an individual service, which give rise to two problems: (1) Top-ranked services may be highly redundant with the same functionality, and (2) The cooperation relations among services are ignored Therefore, we argue that services should be recommended not individually, but collectively In this paper, we focus on the problem of recommending service sets instead of services A service set contains a list of functionally distinct services that collectively match different aspects of functional requirements and are more inclined to compose together following mashup composition patterns To this end, we propose a novel recommendation framework consisting of two stages: Service Set Generation Stage and Serv."
795,ICWS4,Strategic Web-Service Agreements.,"Web services have become quite popular over the last few years as they allow easier development and integration of business applications Unlike traditional software systems, web services are self-contained modular software components that are delivered over a network (such as the Internet) and executed on a remote system hosting the requested services However, the network and processing overhead associated with web services have also presented a significant challenge to its performance As a result, a web service provider often announces a service-level agreement when launching a service The service-level agreement provides a guarantee to the consumers that they can get the service they pay for at an assured level of quality In this paper, we study the competition between two such providers offering functionally the same web services Each provider needs to decide a service level (standard or premium) she would offer and a corresponding price for the selected service level to meet the Q."

802,ICWS1,Access Control for Semantic Web Services.,"Web service is a new service-oriented computing paradigm which poses the unique security challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, multi-domain characteristic and highly dynamic nature A key challenge in Web services security is the design of effective access control schemes Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is more appropriate than some other access control mechanisms, but it do not fully exploit the semantic power and reasoning capabilities of emerging web applications So a semantic-aware attribute-based access control model (SABAC) is presented to address these issues by combining the ABAC with the Semantic Web technologies in this paper SABAC grants access to services based on attributes of the related entities, and uses Shibboleth service to address the disclosure issue of the sensitive attributes In addition, SABAC uses the Web Ontology Language (OWL) standard to represent the ontology of the resources and users and uses eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) ."
803,ICWS2,Behavioral matchmaking for service retrieval.,"The capability to easily find useful services (software applications, software components, scientific computations) becomes increasingly critical in several fields Current approaches for services retrieval are mostly limited to the matching of their inputs/outputs possibly enhanced with some ontological knowledge Recent works have demonstrated that this approach is not sufficient to discover relevant components In this paper we argue that, in many situations, the service discovery should be based on the specification of service behavior (in particular, the conversation protocol) The idea behind is to develop matching techniques that operate on behavior models and allow delivery of partial matches and evaluation of semantic distance between these matches and the user requirements Consequently, even if a service satisfying exactly the user requirements does not exist, the most similar ones will be retrieved and proposed for reuse by extension or modification To do so, we reduce the prob."

1274,IEEE SCC3,Data Augmentation as a Service for Single View Creation.,"This paper draws on two independent strands of literature — Baudrillard's orders-of-simulacra theoretic and financial accounting theory — to investigate the ontological status of information in accounting reports It draws on Baudrillard's concepts of simulacra, hyperreality and implosion to trace the historical transformations of the accounting signs of income and capital from Sumerian times to the present It posits that accounting today no longer refers to any objective reality but instead circulates in a “hyperreality” of self-referential models The paper then examines this conclusion from the viewpoint of recent clean surplus model research and argues that the distinction between income and capital is arbitrary and irrelevant provided the measurement process satisfies the clean surplus relation Although accounting is arbitrary and hyperreal, it does impart a sense of exogeniety and predictability, particularly through the income calculation Therefore, it can be relied on for decisi."
1275,IEEE SCC4,Policy-Based Automation to Improve Solution Engineering in IT Services.,"Advancements in information and communication technologies have allowed the development of new approaches to the management and use of healthcare resources Nowadays it is possible to address complex issues such as meaningful access to distributed data or communication and understanding among heterogeneous systems As a consequence, the discussion focuses on the administration of the whole set of resources providing knowledge about a single subject of care (SoC) New trends make the SoC administrator and responsible for all these elements (related to his/her demographic data, health, well-being, social conditions, etc) and s/he is granted the ability of controlling access to them by third parties The subject of care exchanges his/her passive role without any decision capacity for an active one allowing to control who accesses whatWe study the necessary access control infrastructure to support this approach and develop mechanisms based on semantic tools to assist the subject of care with ."
1276,IEEE SCC5,Traffic Analysis as a Service via a Unified Model.,"Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) analyze data that are collected by sensors, which monitor the network traffic Any alert generated by the IDS is transmitted to a cybersecurity operations center (CSOC), which performs the important task of analyzing the alerts In order to deliver a strong security against threats, an efficient CSOC requires the following characteristics: 1) all alerts must be analyzed in a timely manner; 2) there must be an ideal mix of analyst expertise levels in the organization because the quality of analysis performed depends on the mix; and 3) there must be adequate operating budget to hire the required number of analyst personnel However, it is non-trivial for a CSOC manager to establish the parameter settings for the above characteristics for a desired CSOC efficiency, and current literature lacks a thorough analysis of the tradeoffs between them This void is filled by this paper whose research objective is to develop an optimized tradeoff study model of the C."
1277,IEEE SCW6,Storing and Discovering Critical Workflows from Log in Scientific Exploration.,"This paper aims at effectively reproducing the results of previous scientific workflow executions We first identify the information that needs to be recorded in a workflow execution log, based on which we then determine the data flow among experiments To effectively record a workflow execution log in a relational database management system (RDBMS) when the workflow design is absent, we propose a generic relational storage schema Then techniques have been designed to automatically discover the minimal set of experiments that must be performed in order to reproduce a scientific result by posing appropriate SQL queries Although such SQL queries can be evaluated using an off-the-shelf database system, we investigate the unique characteristics of the workflow log data and optimization techniques for evaluating such SQL queries efficiently."

1279,IEEE SCC8,Services Pricing through Business Value Modeling and Analysis.,"This study draws on literature at the intersection of servitization, digital business models and supply chain management Work empirically explores how digital disruption has affected Business-to-Business (B2B) interdependencies Dematerialization of physical products is transforming the way firms are positioned in the supply chain due to a reduction in production and transport costs and the different ways business engage with customers Specifically, we propose that these new market conditions can empower downstream firms We further propose that upstream firms can still capture additional value through digital service if their servitized offer includes difficult to imitate elements The context of the analysis is the publishing industry The Payment Card method employed is used to test UK and US consumer's perceptions of digital formats (eBooks) and assess their willingness to pay in relation to printed formats The method undertaken enables us to elicit aggregated consumer demand for eBoo."
1280,IEEE SCC9,Towards Efficient Verification for Process Composition of Semantic Web Services.,"Model checking is a formal verification method widely accepted in the web service world because of its capability to reason about service behavior at process level It has been used as a basic tool in several scenarios such as service selection, service validation, and service composition The importance of semantics is also widely recognized Indeed, there are several solutions to the problem of providing semantics to web services, most of them relying on some form of Description Logic This paper presents an integration of model checking and semantic reasoning technologies in an efficient way This can be considered the first step toward the use of semantic model checking in problems of selection, validation, and composition The approach relies on a representation of services at process level that is based on semantically annotated state transition systems (asts) and a representation of specifications based on a semantically annotated version of computation tree logic (anctl) This paper ."
1281,IEEE SCC0,Assessing the Health of Case-Oriented Semi-structured Business Processes.,"Results Over 8 months, 574 patients with AP completed follow-up (10% appendicitis, 13% other pathology, 77% benign/resolving conditions) For patient assessments by the staff EP ( n = 457), the MET-AP recommendation was correct for 72% of patients (95% CI's: 679–761), while the physician's prediction was correct in 70% of cases (659–742) ( p = 0518) However, staff EP triage plans were more conservative than those generated by MET-AP, and a small number of patients whose triage plan should have been “consult surgery” would have been “discharged” by MET-AP For resident assessments ( n = 339), MET-AP and physician accuracies were slightly lower, but not statistically different from staff results or from each other Inter-observer agreement on most attributes was moderate to near perfect Conclusion MET-AP shows promise in recommending the correct triage plan with similar overall accuracy to experienced pediatric EPs, but requires further research to improve accuracy and safety MET-AP can be."
1282,IEEE SCC1,Services Ecosystem.,"An increasing amount of information is being collected on the ecological and socio-economic value of goods and services provided by natural and semi-natural ecosystems However, much of this information appears scattered throughout a disciplinary academic literature, unpublished government agency reports, and across the World Wide Web In addition, data on ecosystem goods and services often appears at incompatible scales of analysis and is classified differently by different authors In order to make comparative ecological economic analysis possible, a standardized framework for the comprehensive assessment of ecosystem functions, goods and services is needed In response to this challenge, this paper presents a conceptual framework and typology for describing, classifying and valuing ecosystem functions, goods and services in a clear and consistent manner In the following analysis, a classification is given for the fullest possible range of 23 ecosystem functions that provide a much larg."

1284,IEEE SCC3,Modeling Non-Functional Aspects in Service Oriented Architecture.,"Currently, non-functional requirements (NFRs) consume a considerable part of the software development effort The good news is that most of them appear time and again during system development and, luckily, their solutions can be often described as a pattern independently from any specific application or domain A proof of this are the current application servers and middleware platforms that can provide configurable prebuilt services for managing some of these crosscutting concerns, or aspects Nevertheless, these reusable pattern solutions presents two shortcomings, among others: (1) they need to be applied manually; and (2) most of these pattern solutions do not use aspect-orientation, and, since NFRs are often crosscutting concerns, this leads to scattered and tangled representations of these concerns Our approach aims to overcome these limitations by: (1) using model-driven techniques to reduce the development effort associated to systematically apply reusable solutions for satisfyi."
1285,IEEE SCC4,A Two-Phase Online Prediction Approach for Accurate and Timely Adaptation Decision.,"Methods We performed LVOT measurement in 20 normal subjects and 83 patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis with a transthoracic real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (3D-TTE) technique in two systolic frames The off-line 3D-evaluation allows full choice of section planes within the acquired volume data set The aortic valve area was calculated from systolic LVOT areas These results were compared to area values obtained by M-mode LVOT-diameters (area = π ⁎ ( d / 2) 2 ) In addition, the calculated aortic valve orifices were compared to invasive measurements or direct planimetry in the transthoracic or transesophageal examination Results Two independent observers found a reduction in LVOT area during systole ( p < 0001) Often a more ellipsoid-like shaped LVOT resulted at end-systole which was shown by a reduction ( p < 0001) of the LVOT longitudinal to oblique axis ratio 3D-TTE determination of aortic valve orifice areas (mean difference: − 004 ± 009 cm 2 ) showed a lesser."
1286,IEEE SCC5,Towards Financial Planning as a Service.,"Despite changes to the abortion legislation in South Africa in 1996, barriers to women accessing abortion services still exist including provider opposition to abortions and a shortage of trained and willing abortion care providers The dearth of abortion providers undermines the availability of safe, legal abortion, and has serious implications for women's access to abortion services and health service planningIn South Africa, little is known about the personal and professional attitudes of individuals who are currently working in abortion service provision Exploring the factors which determine health care providers' involvement or disengagement in abortion services may facilitate improvement in the planning and provision of future servicesQualitative research methods were used to collect data Thirty four in-depth interviews and one focus group discussion were conducted during 2006 and 2007 with health care providers who were involved in a range of abortion provision in the Western Ca."
